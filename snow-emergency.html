    <img src="img/100px-line.png">
    <p class="project-p-top">As the modern world grows evermore attached to digital spaces and mediums, the platforms used to disseminate and deliver important information must adapt to new user needs and expectations. The city of St. Paul budgets for up to four snow emergencies per year at a cost of multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars per emergency. Snow emergencies are declared when there is accumulation of 3” or more, and may also include the snow/water ratio, existing road conditions, future weather, end of snow events, and actions taken by other cities.
    <p class="project-p">These events produce widespread impacts for citizens, requiring a large-scale information hub to address a variety of subjects. The city’s snow emergency website is maintained by the Public Works department but also connected to the Department of Safety and Inspections (sidewalk regulations) and the Office of Technology and Communications (interactive mapping tool).

        </h2>
        <img src="img/100px-line.png">
        <p class="project-p-top">
          Working with a team from the St. Paul Office of Technology and Communications (SPOTC), our student group (a part of WRIT 4501W: Usability and Human Factors in Technical Communication at UMN - Twin Cities) aimed to evaluate the usability of the city website’s section for snow emergencies and related information.
        </p>
        <p class="project-p">
          More specifically, there were three main areas of interest presented by the SPOTC team. These included the landing page content, the interactive parking map functionality, and the site’s local navigation.
        </p>
        <p class="project-p">
          Our group was tasked with completing a usability study of the local site, which involved developing a usability test plan, recruiting participants, conducting usability testing, analyzing and compiling the resting data, and presenting a final report to the class and SPOTC team.

          In order to recruit representative participants for our study, we utilized demographic and analytical data presented by the SPOTC team.
        </p>
        <p class="project-p">
          Their primary users were people who are familiar with snow emergencies, who are responsible for moving their vehicle during the plowing phases of the event, and/or who may be angrily searching for plowing information for their street.
        </p>
        <p class="project-p">
          According to provided website visitor demographics, the largest portion of visitors were White alone (48.8%), followed by Asian alone (19.2%), Black or African American alone (16.5%), Hispanic or Latino (9.7%), two or more races (4.7%), and some other race alone (1.25%).

      <p class="project-p-top">
        The provided data and project objectives prompted our team to construct four scenarios for users to complete, including one that involved identifying the snow emergency status and signing up for SMS alerts, the next focused on identifying plowing times in conjunction with moving a vehicle, another based on locating information related to a vehicle being towed, and a final scenario tasking users with locating and sending translated resources to others whose primary language is Spanish.

      Usability Testing Results
    </h2>
    <p class="project-p-top">
      Three of the four scenarios were met with satisfactory levels of success. The second scenario, which involved locating plowing routes and times in order to determine when to move a vehicle, utilized the interactive mapping tool recently designed by the SPOTC team. This scenario resulted in the largest quantity of pain points, however post-testing analysis indicates that the scenario tasks were lacking a certain level of clarity, likely heightening the confusion experienced by the participants. Even then, the pain points and uncertainties experienced within the testing scenarios offered strong direction towards evaluating the website’s usability and providing both recommendations for new design iterations and potential re-testing opportunities for the future.

    </div>
    <p class="project-p-top">
      Conducting an end-to-end usability study helps to establish the context of its components. Although this study was limited by time constrictions, our student group was able to utilize the background information provided to us in order to offer realistic recommendations and guidelines for testing replication. I would have appreciated the opportunity to further refine scenarios beforehand in order to hopefully garner more objective pain points and user journeys, however I’m still proud of the work we accomplished and the ability to closely work with a professional team throughout the experience.
